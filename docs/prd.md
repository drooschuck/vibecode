# Product Requirements Document: softvibe

## 1. Executive Summary
Softvibe aims to lower the barrier to entry for learning programming by providing an all-in-one environment that combines curriculum, code editing, execution, and AI-driven mentorship.

## 2. Target Audience
- **Absolute Beginners**: Students with zero prior coding experience.
- **CS Students**: Individuals looking for a lightweight, browser-based sandbox to practice syntax.
- **Self-Learners**: People transitioning into tech who need structured guidance.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Course Management
- Users can select from three main paths: Python, Java, and C.
- Progress tracking per lesson and per course.
- Visual indicators (checkmarks) for completed modules.

### 3.2 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Syntax highlighting for multiple languages.
- Ability to provide Standard Input (STDIN) before execution.
- Clear separation between Output and Input panels.

### 3.3 AI Mentorship
- On-demand feedback based on the current lesson context.
- Hint-first approach to prevent students from just copying solutions.
- Analysis of student-written code to identify logic errors.

### 3.4 Execution Sandbox
- Remote execution of code to ensure safety and performance.
- Support for multiple standard compilers (GCC, OpenJDK, Python 3).

## 4. User Experience (UX) Goals
- **Immediacy**: Users should go from landing to running their first line of code in under 3 clicks.
- **Encouragement**: Use statistics like "Streak Days" and "Hours Learned" to motivate daily practice.
- **Clarity**: High-contrast syntax highlighting and clear error messages.
